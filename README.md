## Important

* The backend is in the `server` folder.
* Before uploading courses or anything else, create categories (e.g., web dev, Python, etc.) without which courses cannot be added. To create categories, create an Admin account and go to the dashboard, then the admin panel.
* To create an Admin account, first sign up with a student or instructor account, then go to your Database under the users model and change the 'accountType' to 'Admin'.
